                <p>The ‘Laser Safety Tester’ device (above) was used to control the power of an IR laser to test its power output against toy safety standards in different laser pulse scenarios.</p>
                <p>For this task, I firstly travelled to Hong Kong to deliver a key production equipment (a free-wave spectrum analyser worth over £20,000!) and train our engineers in Hong Kong on how to use it based on my time with it in the UK. Secondly, I was taken to a Shenzhen laser safety test lab to help their engineers use the device above and provide us with their test results.</p>
                <p>The device above consisted of an STM32F746NG development board, connected to two push-buttons and two potentiometers. The laser that was being used is the same style laser that was used in the Mars guns. The firmware was written in C++, and used SPI and I2C communication protocols to interface the controls with the microcontroller. The device was intended to allow the the PWM signal of the IR laser to be finely tuned via a simple interface.</p>
                <p><em>Please note, the final product actually included labels to describe the purpose of each of the controls, but the photo above was the most recent photo I was able to find!</em></p>



                <p>Although designed to look like a ‘fan-made’ video, PDP were impressed by the quality of the explanations I provided and decided to create an official video inspired by the video above.</p>
